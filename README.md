Report Summary:

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a medical dataset with the aim of understanding the factors influencing hospital readmission for diabetic patients. The analysis begins with extensive data exploration, examining variables such as age, gender, A1C results, and medication usage to uncover patterns and correlations. Notably, it reveals a decrease in A1C abnormal results with patient age and a gender-based disparity in A1C readings. The study further delves into the length of hospital stays, diagnoses, and the relationship between these variables and readmission rates. Next, predictive machine learning models are introduced, including a Random Forest model, Decision Trees model, and Logistic Regression. These models are evaluated based on performance metrics such as accuracy and recall. Both the Decision Tree and the Random Forest models emphasize important features, while the Decision Trees model also provides insights into how decisions are made. The Logistic Regression model offers a straightforward binary classification approach. This holistic approach provides valuable insights for medical practitioners and stakeholders in predicting patient readmission and improving patient care and outcomes.
